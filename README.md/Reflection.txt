## Reflection

Building NeighborFit has been a really rewarding journey for me. I got hands-on experience connecting a React frontend with a Node.js backend, and learned how to use JSON data in a way that actually solves a real problem. Creating the matching algorithm was especially interesting—it showed me how user preferences can be turned into meaningful, personalized results.

Of course, there were challenges along the way! Making sure the backend and frontend communicated smoothly (especially after changing the dataset) sometimes took a lot of careful testing and troubleshooting. But working through those issues taught me how important it is to keep things organized and to test each part of the app as I go.

I’m really happy with how the app looks and feels. It’s clean, classic, and easy for anyone to use. If I had more time, I’d love to add features like user accounts, saving preferences, and maybe even use a bigger, real-world dataset. Putting the app online for others to try would be a great next step, too.

Overall, this project has boosted my confidence in full-stack development and made me excited to build more apps that help people in practical ways.
